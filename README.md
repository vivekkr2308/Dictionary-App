## Project o**bjective**

- You will be building a Dictionary app project using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- In the end, we will have a frontend application in which you can search for meaning of words and check your search history.
- The API we are going to use in this project is    `https://api.dictionaryapi.dev/api/v2/entries/en/hello`
- The format of API is [`https://api.dictionaryapi.dev/api/v2/entries/en/](https://api.dictionaryapi.dev/api/v2/entries/en/)<word>`

## **Project Context**

- We all do reading and get confused with the meaning of some words so it would be helpful if we had an application where we search for words and get the meaning of words and a page where we could see all the searched words.
- The reason for the creation of this website is to make a platform where people can search for the specific words and it would save in search history to read them later .

**Tech stack Prerequisite:**  HTML, CSS, JavaScript.

## ****Project Steps****

- **Step-1**: Set up the project
    - Set up folder in which you have html , css and Javascript files that will contain code for your application.
    - It may also contains some images which will be required in the application
- **Step-2**:The search words page
    - This  page will appear first when user opens the application.
    - When button History is clicked then the user is directed to history page
    - On this page we have a search `button` and an `input field`.
    - Whenever any word is entered in the `input field` and `search button` is clicked then a `word card` is generated which contains the meaning of that particular word .
- **Step-3**:The history page
    - On this page there are multiple `word cards` which are the words that has been searched
    - They all contain a `delete button` which when clicked will delete that `word card` from `local storage`
- **Step-4:**Saving data to localStorage
